How it Works
------------
Volunteers mark sales using a Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi updates the sales database. Event managers can check on sales statistics online throughout the event to make decisions about supplying vendors. After the concert, the information generated by the app can be analyzed to predict demand for future events.

Dependencies
------------
Django 1.6

PostgreSQL 9.1.13
